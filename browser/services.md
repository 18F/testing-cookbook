## Browser Testing Services
These services allow you to run virtual browsers right in your browser:

* [Browserling] is the original live cross-browser testing service. The [free plan](https://browserling.com/#pricing) gives you access to IE9 in 3-minute sessions at 1024x768. All other browsers are free.
* [BrowserStack] features an [exhaustive platform list](http://www.browserstack.com/list-of-browsers-and-platforms?product=live) but [lacks a free plan](https://www.browserstack.com/pricing).
* [Cross-Browser Testing] supports [tons of different platforms](https://crossbrowsertesting.com/browsers), but [lacks a free plan](https://crossbrowsertesting.com/pricing).
* [Sauce Labs] also [requires an account](https://saucelabs.com/pricing), but gives you [tons of platforms](https://saucelabs.com/platforms/) and provides a native application, which tends to be marginally faster than the in-browser environment. It's also [free for open source projects](https://saucelabs.com/opensauce/).
* [TestingBot] has a [free trial plan](http://testingbot.com/pricing) and supports [lots of different platforms](http://testingbot.com/support/getting-started/browsers.html).

### Screenshot Services
These services can be used to take screenshots of public sites:

* [Browsera] visually analyzes the layout differences between browsers. Its [free plan is very limited](https://www.browsera.com/plans).
* [Browser Shots] takes screenshots with lots of different browsers at once and presents them to you on one page for comparison. **No IE support, unfortunately.**
* [IE NetRenderer] takes screenshots with different versions of IE (5.5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11 as of this writing).

### Other Testing Tools

* [Ghostlab] *looks* very cool (especially for mobile testing), but it does not appear to run virtual machines.
* [Spoon's](https://spoon.net) [Browser Sandbox] has [a free plan for open source](https://spoon.net/pricing) (for automated testing only), but it doesn't include legacy OS support. It's also Windows-only.
